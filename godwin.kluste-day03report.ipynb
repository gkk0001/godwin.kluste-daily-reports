    "### What is Version Control ?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In software development, revision control systems (RCS) are essential tools. They are widely used across all development environments and by developers everywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "RCS are versatile and not limited to just software projects; they are also invaluable for managing various types of digital content, including manuscripts, figures, data, and notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Revision control systems (RCS) serve two primary purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Track Changes in Source Code:**\n",
    "   - Enable tracking and managing changes to the source code.\n",
    "   - Allow reverting to previous versions if issues arise.\n",
    "   - Support working on multiple \"branches\" of the software at the same time.\n",
    "   - Use tags to identify and manage different versions, such as \"release-1.0\" or \"paper-A-final.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Facilitate Collaborative Development:**\n",
    "   - Allow multiple contributors to work on the same codebase simultaneously.\n",
    "   - Enable numerous authors to make and integrate changes.\n",
    "   - Provide clear communication and visualization of changes to all team members.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Principles and Terminology of Revision Control Systems (RCS)\n",
    "\n",
    "In an RCS, source code or digital content is managed within a repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Repository:** Stores not only the latest version of files but also the complete history of all changes made to these files since their initial addition to the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Checkout:** Users obtain a local working copy of the files from the repository. Changes are made to these local files, allowing for additions, deletions, and updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Commit:** After completing a task, changes made to the local files are saved back to the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conflict Resolution:** If changes have been made by others to the same files, conflicts may arise. The system often resolves conflicts automatically, but manual intervention may be necessary to merge conflicting changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Branches and Forks:** For larger experimental developments, it’s common to create a new branch, fork, or clone of the repository. The primary branch is usually called `master` or `trunk`. Once work on a branch or fork is finished, it can be merged back into the main branch or repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Distributed RCS:** Systems like Git or Mercurial allow for pulling and pushing changesets between different repositories. For instance, changes can be pushed from a local repository to a central online repository, such as those hosted on platforms like GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In a few words, **version control** is a way to keep a backup of the changes in your\n",
    "files and to store a history of those changes.  The key charateristic of VC is that and it\n",
    "allows many people in a collaboration to make changes to the same files\n",
    "concurrently. VC is done via a VC system and there are a lot of them. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control)\n",
    "provides both a nice vocabulary list and a fairly complete table of some\n",
    "popular version control systems and their equivalent commands.\n",

    "- **Mercurial (hg):** [http://mercurial.selenic.com/](http://mercurial.selenic.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the remainder of this lecture, we will focus on Git. However, Mercurial is equally effective and operates in a very similar manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using git. `Git` is an example of a distributed version control system, distinct from centralized versing control systems. I'll not discuss the distinction, but for now, the table below will\n",
